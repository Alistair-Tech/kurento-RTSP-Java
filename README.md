The web application is capable of doing the following:
1. Receive an WebRTC media stream from a URI
2. Broadcast the media stream to multiple end users using WebRTC.
3. Ensure error handling in case of broken streams and add multiple streams
dynamically.
4. Allow the user to start or stop the incoming stream that is being displayed

I have managed to put the back-end in place. However, I am facing problems in getting my front-end working.
